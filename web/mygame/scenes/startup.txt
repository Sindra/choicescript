You growl softly at the slight pain in your side, but you power on through the woods anyway. Sadly though you can not ignore the bloodloss. 
But it would seem that luck is on your side, not far off is a small house with a few of the lights on. Though you are pretty far away you can hear voices from within.

  #Approch the house.
    If you can get there in time you can most likly heal you wounds, but why would they let a bleeding covored in mud person in?
    *choice
      #See if you cann't draw someone out.
        This hopefuly would work, but drawing one person out, even if there is someone would be hard to do.
        *finish
      #Wait for the moon.
        Waiting for the moon will cause you to loose more blood but once you feel it's gaze, well lets just say that even with your wound the house will be easy pickings.
        *finish
